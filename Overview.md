# Overview: Deploying a Web App Using Azure App Service #
Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps. It supports multiple languages (like .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP) and integrates with DevOps tools for continuous deployment.

## **General Hierarchy**
- App Service Plan – Defines the compute resources (CPU, memory, and region) for your app.
- Web App – The actual application running inside the App Service Plan.
- Deployment Slots (Optional) – Staging environments for testing before production.
- Custom Domains & SSL – Secure your app with a custom domain and HTTPS.

## **Key Benefits of Azure App Service**
- Easy Deployment – Deploy code directly from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or local repositories.
- Automatic Scaling – Scale up or out based on demand.
- Built-in Security – HTTPS, authentication, and compliance certifications.
- High Availability – Runs on Azure’s global infrastructure with auto-patching.
- Cost-Effective – Pay only for the resources you use.
