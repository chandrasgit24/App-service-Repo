# Exercise 1: Create App Service Plan & Web App
Azure App Service is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft Azure that enables you to:
- Deploy web apps (ASP.NET, Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, static sites)
- Scale automatically based on demand
- Secure with built-in HTTPS, authentication, and compliance
- Integrate with databases, APIs, and DevOps pipelines

### **Task 1: Create a App Service**
1. Search for "App Services" In the Azure Portal top search bar, type "App Services" and select it from the dropdown.

1. Now, In the continuous Deployment section : Enable the Deployment section and after that Set up GitHub Actions to push content to your app whenever there are code changes made to your repository. Note: Your GitHub account must have write access to the selected repository in order to add a workflow file which manages deployments to your app.
- Give the github account Details
- Enter your Github organization Details
- Select the repository which you have stored your script
- Select the branch (Ex: main bracnch/Feature Branch)
Now Click on next and Go for the networking part

### **Task 2: Create and Set Up App Service Plan**
App Service plans give you the flexibility to allocate specific apps to a given set of resources and further optimize your Azure resource utilization. This way, if you want to save money on your testing environment you can share a plan across multiple apps.

1. Create New App Service Plan Click "Create new" under App Service Plan. Plan Name Enter a name (e.g., ASP-SpektraLab-001).
   ![](Images/16.png)

1. Select the Subcription and resource group and enter the name as App service and select the region as west US
   ![](Images/17.png)

1. Now select the Prizing plan as Premium V3 P1V3 and select review+Create
   ![](Images/18.png)

1. So the Deployment will be completed as shown in figure and Wait for the green "Deployment complete" notification (~1-2 mins)

### **Task 3: Access Your Web App**
1. Go to Resource Click "Go to resource" post-deployment. Test Default Page Under the "Overview" tab, click the URL (e.g., https://webapp-[yourinitials]-001.azurewebsites.net). A default "Your App Service app is up and running" page should load as shown in figure below.
